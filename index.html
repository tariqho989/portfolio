                        <p>As Head of IT Field Support for the Europe III region, I led a distributed team of 58 IT
                            Field Engineers across 26 countries, ensuring seamless delivery of local IT services and
                            high‑quality onsite support. I managed regional escalations, operational risk, and service
                            performance, driving continual improvement of IT operations and customer experience.
                            My responsibilities included overseeing incident management, leading deep‑dive
                            investigations of high‑impact issues, and implementing corrective actions to safeguard
                            service continuity. I ensured alignment with global IT standards, managed SLAs and KPIs, and
                            supported cross‑country engineering collaboration through daily sprint sessions.
                            I coordinated local infrastructure support-from user hardware and applications to network
                            and site technologies-and worked closely with third‑party suppliers in line with DB
                            Schenker’s governance. Additionally, I led implementation of operational frameworks such as
                            Branch Health Check (BHC) and Cyber Café concepts, contributed to major global initiatives
                            including SD‑WAN and cloud migration, and developed Power BI dashboards for strategic

                        <p>As CIO for DB Schenker in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, and North Macedonia, I led the
                            regional IT strategy and operations, ensuring that technology strengthened daily logistics
                            and long‑term business performance. I oversaw critical infrastructure, cybersecurity, and
                            virtualization environments, aligning all systems with global governance and regulatory
                            requirements.
                            My role blended strategic leadership with hands‑on execution-managing network and server
                            platforms, business‑critical applications, and technical security systems across multiple
                            countries. I guided senior management on IT direction, optimized investment plans, and
                            implemented improvements that enhanced stability, security, and operational resilience.
                            I also strengthened IT governance across the region, mentoring teams, standardizing
                            processes, and establishing consistent documentation and compliance practices. This period
                            shaped my approach to leading complex IT ecosystems by balancing innovation, efficiency, and

                            operating systems, networking, programming, web development, AutoCAD, and data analysis. I
                            designed course materials, practical exercises, and exams while mentoring learners as they
                            built real‑world technical skills. Alongside teaching, I authored and co‑authored more than
                            30 IT books and training resources used in formal education programs, helping standardize
                            learning and make complex topics accessible for students at all levels. My experience as an
                            instructor strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts clearly, guide learning
                            effectively, and support the growth of future IT professionals.</p>

                            hardware, software, networks, and operating systems. My responsibilities included

                            as Siemens, Hikvision, Bosch, and Dahua. My role included managing IT projects end‑to‑end,

                            support operational and client needs. I ensured stable IT operations, guided technology

                            the reliability of systems used in humanitarian work. My contribution included administering
                            IT hardware, networks, cloud platforms, backup systems, and Microsoft 365 / Azure AD
                            environments across the organization. Beyond technical work, I provided remote support,
                            trained staff in cybersecurity and digital tools, and developed websites and digital
                            platforms for campaigns, appeals, and organizational transparency. This role became
                            especially meaningful during challenging periods-such as the severe floods in Bosnia and

                            emergency response. This long‑term volunteer engagement allowed me to use my technical
                            expertise to support humanitarian efforts in a way that was purposeful, responsible, and
                            quietly impactful-focused on helping those who help others.</p>
